Previously, I wrote about [the strategy to try all possible sequences of moves]({% post_url 2023-08-02-IDS_A %}).  The take-away from that posting was that there are too many possible move sequences to explore.  I discussed [the importance of preventing useless sequences]({% post_url 2023-08-09-IDS_B %}), which enabled a significant increase in the speed of the IDS solver.  There are still too many sequences, even when we prevent the really useless ones.  I ended with the idea that we should spend more time on sequences that seem promising, and less time on sequences that donâ€™t seem to be helpful.  Let's make that idea clearer, and show how well it works.

**Priorities.**  The IDS solvers worked through all possible move sequences (the second version ignored the useless ones), looking first at sequences of length 1, then length 2, etc, stopping only when a solution was found.  This can be interpreted as a weak kind of prioritization, where the shorter sequences are given higher priority than longer sequences.  I call it weak, because it doesn't care very much about how the tiles move.  All sequences of the same length are considered equal.

We will construct promising sequences by actually looking at the effect of the moves. 
A move that leaves the Toroidal scrambled is not very promising.  A move that puts a few tiles into place seems more promising.  We'll build up promising sequences by adding promising moves to already-promising sequences.  The hope is that an exploration of some of the more promising sequences will solve Toroidal much faster than exploring all possible sequences.  

The easiest way to measure the effect of a sequence of moves is to *count the number of tiles that are not in the correct position*.  When the Toroidal is highly scrambled (see below, left), almost all of the tiles will be in the wrong position, so the count will be relatively high.  When the Toroidal is partially solved (see below, middle), only a few tiles will be out of position, and the count will be relatively low.  And when the Toroidal is solved (below, right), zero tiles are out of position.

**Extending high priority sequences.**  The A\* algorithm is a bit complicated, and I should take the time to explain it for ordinary people.  I'll do that another time.  For now, I will give a very high-level explanation, so that we can move on to the interesting results.

Basically, A\* keeps track of all the sequences it has created in a kind of sorted list, but initially there is only one sequence: the one with zero moves.  The algorithm takes the most promising sequence out of the list, and *extends* it with all the possible single moves.  So in the case of 3x3 Toroidals, one sequence comes out, and up to 12 slightly longer sequences go back in (we'll avoid extending a sequence in useless ways, as before).  However, because we are always taking the most promising sequence out, a lot of the least promising moves stay in the list, and never get extended at all.  If the prioritization measure is effective, the list remains relatively short, and only the very most promising sequences are extended, until a solution is found.

Admittedly, my explanation leaves out a lot of technical details.  But it will suffice for now.

**Running the algorithm.**  I applied this heuristic strategy to the same 100 3x3 Toroidal problems that we used before.  I will summarize the results with the following table:

| Solution length | Simplistic IDS | Enhanced IDS | A\*  |
|:-:|--:|--:|--:|
| 4 |     0.47  |   0.101 |  0.001 |
| 5 |     4.20  |   0.631 |  0.004 |
| 6 |    38.90  |   3.710 |  0.012 |
| 7 |  *400*    |  20.900 |  0.023 |
| 8 | *4000*    | 126.700 |  0.066 |

The data in the columns labelled **Simplistic IDS** and **Enhanced IDS** are average times to find a solution of the given length, copied from the previous postings (italics represent estimated times).  The new column labelled <strong>A\*</strong> is also an average time in seconds, and shows that A\* can solve 3x3 Toroidals in tiny fractions of a second.  On average, this heuristic strategy is more than 500 times faster than the **Enhanced IDS** strategy.  

The algorithm is pretty effective for 3x3 Toroidals.  Surely this problem can be considered "solved." 

**Not so fast.**  I applied this heuristic technique to 4x4 Toroidals.  I mentioned in the previous posting that IDS couldn't solve any of them in a time limit of 60 seconds, even if all the useless sequences are prevented.  Well, A\* MTC cannot solve any of them either.  At least, not in under 60 seconds.  

The problem is that 4x4 is not just a little bigger than 3x3.  It's a lot bigger.  The first thing we'll do is try to find a better prioritization measure.
