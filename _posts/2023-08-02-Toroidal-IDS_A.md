**The simplest possible computer algorithm for Toroidal.**
One of the most basic computer algorithms we can try to use to solve Toroidal is called
Iterative Deepening Search (IDS).  IDS is a general purpose algorithm that can be applied to many different kinds of search problems.  For our purposes, IDS is a way to look through all the possible move sequences by trying all the sequences with 1 move only, then all the sequences with 2 moves, then all the sequences with 3 moves, etc.  Since we know that every Toroidal is solvable, we will find a solution eventually, and it will be the shortest possible solution.

I have a simple implementation of IDS which does nothing fancy.  It tries all the possible combinations of moves, even the ones that are obviously not worth trying, such as `L1 R1 L1 R1` which does nothing useful.  It's simple, but we shouldn't be too hopeful.  It's basically a place to start, and to appreciate the difficulty of the problem.

**Running the program.**
I created 100 random 3x3 Toroidal problems.  These Toroidal problems have 9 unique tiles (that is, there are no exchangeable tiles to make the problem easier), and each Toroidal was scrambled using 500 random moves.  I applied my Simple version of IDS to these 100 problems.  The solver was given a time limit of 120 seconds, which is plenty of time for a human to solve a 3x3 Toroidal.  

It was able to solve 62 out of 100 3x3 Toroidals.  The other 38 were unsolved.  Of these 62 solved problems, there were solutions of length 4, 5, and 6.  The remaining 38 Toroidals have solutions of length 7 and higher, which this version of the solver was unable to find within the 2 minute time limit.  The results are summarized below:

| Solution length | Number | Average time (seconds)|
|:-:|--:|--:|
| 4 | 7 | 0.47 |
| 5 | 17 | 4.20 |
| 6 | 38 | 38.90 |

The trend in the average time required to solve Toroidal is pretty obvious.  Solutions of length 5 take about 10 times longer to find on average than solutions of length 4.  Likewise, solutions of length 6 also take about 10 times longer that solutions of length 5.  We could be more precise than "about 10 times" but we're just getting started, so there's no need to nail down this factor precisely.

If we assume that this trend continues to solutions of length 7 and 8, we can predict that to find a solution of length 7, weâ€™ll need about 10 times longer than we needed for solutions of length 6, or about 400 seconds (just over 6 minutes).  To find solutions of length 8, about 4000 seconds (just over 1 hour).  

**Simple IDS is not good enough.**
These estimates are not good news for the Simple IDS implementation.  A human should be able to solve any 3x3 Toroidal in a couple of minutes.  The Simple strategy of checking every sequence up to length 8 considers too many useless sequences.
