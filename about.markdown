**Toroidal** is the name I have given to a puzzle game I have been
working on in my retirement.  You can find my version of it here: [Toroidal]({{ site.toroidal_url }}). The game challenges the player to rearrange a rectangular grid of image tiles, to produce an image of some kind.  You can slide tiles left or right, up or down.  The whole row (or column) moves, and any tile pushed towards the edge of 
the grid reappears on the opposite side.  
<br/>
My blog here will teach you how to solve Toroidal, if you want to play the game yourself. 
I will also discuss the application of "classical" Artificial Intelligence to this problem to develop a computer Toroidal solver.
